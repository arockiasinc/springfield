              <p className="card-text">
                Natural and environmental factors will affect cabinetry products over time. The following are special considerations that will affect the warranty.
              </p>
              <ul className="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li className="list-group-item">
                  Doors that are warped ¼ inch or less must be allowed to hang through 3 seasons before replacement will be made. Typically, the door will return to its normal flat position after conditioning to its environment.
                </li>
                <li className="list-group-item">
                  Stain variation: Since no two trees are the same, wood is a unique material with natural variations in the grain, texture and color. These variations may also be noticeable between samples and new cabinets. Replacement product will never match exactly to existing product inside a home
                </li>
                <li className="list-group-item">
                  Thermofoil products: This warranty does not apply to thermofoil products. The thermofoil manufacturers typically offers a limited 5 year on delamination of glue and 1 year on color change. There is no warranty for melted or discolored vinyl. Care must be taken to avoid direct heat or steam, boiling kettles, toaster ovens, extreme uncovered cooking close to cabinet edges and weak gaskets seals on ovens can all seriously damage thermofoil products.

              <h5 className="card-title mb-3">Wood Finish Awareness</h5>
              <p className="card-text">
                Wood finish Awareness: painted finishes or painted finishes with glaze is a classic look over solid hardwoods or veneers. These woods are natural products that have seasonal movement due to the climatic conditions. This is normal in high quality products manufactured from Hardwoods. Seasonal movement can cause normal small hairline cracks at the wood joints. Grain pattern and wood characteristics (mineral streaks, pitch pockets, checks and pin knots) as well as seams and joints will remain visible through the painted finish. There will be a slight mellowing of the solid color, from the exposure to natural and artificial light. This is characteristic of fine paint furniture and cabinetry. These changes are all normal and not considered to be warranty defects.
              </p>
              <p className="card-text mb-0">
                All wood products expand and contract throughout the seasons, to ensure that your cabinetry and furniture in your home remains stable we recommend that the humidity is maintained at a min. of 40%.
